    <h2>About This Garden</h2>
    <div id="aboutText">
      <p>Bloom & Share is a digital space born from a very analogue tradition the act of giving flowers. Flowers have always carried layered meanings in cultures worldwide, including Sri Lanka: purity, celebration, remembrance, and healing.</p>
      
      <div class="extra-about hidden">
        <p>The core idea is simple: choose a flower, pair it with a short message, and send it digitally. But the thinking behind it is layered. The flowers featured here are not random each one has a story. Many are native or deeply symbolic in Sri Lankan society.</p>
        
        <p>Design-wise, the platform follows a minimalist and deliberate aesthetic. White space is used not to fill, but to breathe. Illustrations are soft, avoiding overly saturated stock visuals. Typography is chosen to evoke both clarity and a sense of hand-touched intention.</p>
        
        <p>Bloom & Share was conceived with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a space where people could connect, express their emotions, and send thoughtful gestures of love and appreciation through the beauty of flowers. In the digital age, where physical distance often separates us, this project seeks to bridge the gap by offering a unique, interactive experience that brings the timeless tradition of giving flowers into the modern world.</p>
        
        <p>The idea began as a way to celebrate the cultural significance of flowers, particularly those native to Sri Lanka. Each flower carries with it a story, a meaning, and a deep connection to the island's rich cultural tapestry. By allowing users to pick a flower, customise a message, and send it as a virtual bouquet, we provide a personalised and meaningful way to share emotions—love, gratitude, sympathy, or joy.</p>
        
        <p>At its heart, Bloom & Share is more than just a website; it is a digital garden where users can explore a curated collection of Sri Lankan flowers, each with unique characteristics and symbolism. From the delicate jasmine to the vibrant lotus, every flower represents a specific sentiment, allowing users to express themselves in an impactful way.</p>
        
        <p>We understand that flowers have the power to convey messages that words alone cannot. A single bloom can speak volumes, whether it's a celebration of a special occasion or a simple gesture to brighten someone's day. Our goal is to make this experience accessible to anyone, regardless of location, by bringing the beauty and symbolism of flowers to the digital space.</p>
        
        <p>Bloom & Share is not just about sending flowers; it's about fostering connections. The project was designed to create a lasting emotional impact. It offers people a platform to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a personal, intimate, yet universal way. Through our website, users can send flowers and learn about their meanings, deepen their understanding of cultural traditions, and engage with a growing community of flower enthusiasts.</p>
        
        <p>The project is built on the belief that flowers can bring joy, healing, and positivity, no matter where they are. Using watercolour illustrations, we ensure that the site has a soft, inviting aesthetic that aligns with the serene beauty of nature. The minimalist design highlights the flowers, allowing users to immerse themselves in the experience without distraction. We hope every site visit feels like stepping into a garden—a place where beauty and emotion flourish together.</p>
        
        <p>Each flower on the site has been carefully selected to reflect the natural beauty of Sri Lankan flora and its emotional significance. Whether for a wedding, a birthday, a moment of sympathy, or to say "I'm thinking of you," our flowers offer the perfect way to convey a message of warmth and affection.</p>
        
        <p>As Bloom & Share evolves, we aim to expand our offerings and enhance the user experience, creating new ways for people to share their stories through the language of flowers. Our commitment is to ensure that every interaction with the site feels special, meaningful, and memorable.</p>
